This directory (temporarily) contains copies of "LSST throughput curves". The
copies in this directory should be identical to the copies in Docushare collection-1777,
for the individual components. (Calculated 'total*' throughput curves are slightly 
different due to using a different atmosphere to calculate this total throughput). 

Please note that these throughput curves are subject to change as studies are ongoing of
detector performance, filter throughput, mirror coatings, etc. 
These should not be taken as expected LSST performance curves without further 
discussion with the Camera Team. 

"ideal_*dat" curves represent the filter throughputs alone (without the addition of
the lenses, mirrors, atmosphere, detector). 

"total*.dat" curves represent the total throughput curve, in other words, the total
sensitivity of the LSST system. 

"atmos*.dat" curves represent various atmosphere throughputs at different airmasses
(the 10 = 1.0 airmass, _18 = 1.8 airmass, etc.), using MODTRAN to generate these
'standard' atmospheres.  
"atmos.dat" itself is the currently used "standard atmosphere" for LSST. It is 
approximately the same as the MODTRAN X=1.2 atmosphere.
